## üéØ Business Problem

**Challenge**: E-commerce platforms face two critical challenges that directly impact sales and customer satisfaction:

1. **Inaccurate Rating Calculations**: Simple average ratings fail to account for temporal factors and review quality, leading to misleading product scores
2. **Poor Review Sorting**: Unhelpful or misleading reviews appearing at the top can significantly impact purchase decisions and customer trust

### Key Business Questions
1. **Rating Accuracy**: How can we calculate more accurate product ratings that reflect current product quality?
2. **Review Relevance**: Which reviews should be displayed prominently to maximize customer value?
3. **Temporal Impact**: How does review age affect rating reliability?
4. **Quality Metrics**: What scoring method best identifies helpful reviews?
5. **Conversion Optimization**: How can better ratings and reviews increase sales?

---

## üõ† Methodology

### Rating Calculation Methods

#### 1. Simple Average Rating
```python
simple_rating = df['overall'].mean()
# Result: 4.5876
```

#### 2. Time-Weighted Average Rating
```python
# Weight distribution by recency quartiles
w1=28% (Most Recent), w2=26%, w3=24%, w4=22% (Oldest)

time_weighted_rating = 4.5956
# Improvement: +0.17% over simple average
```

### Review Sorting Algorithms

#### 1. **Wilson Lower Bound Score** (Recommended)
- **Purpose**: Provides statistically robust review ranking
- **Formula**: Considers both positive ratio and sample size
- **Advantage**: Prevents low-sample reviews from ranking too high
- **Best Score**: 0.958 (1952 helpful from 2020 votes)

#### 2. **Score Positive-Negative Difference**
- **Formula**: `helpful_yes - helpful_no`
- **Use Case**: Simple difference metric
- **Limitation**: Ignores total vote count

#### 3. **Average Rating Score**
- **Formula**: `helpful_yes / total_vote`
- **Use Case**: Helpful ratio calculation
- **Limitation**: Biased toward low-vote reviews

### Statistical Framework

```python
# Scoring comparison for top review
Review #2031:
- Wilson Lower Bound: 0.958 ‚≠ê (BEST)
- Helpful Votes: 1952/2020 (96.6%)
- Product Rating: 5.0
- Statistical Confidence: Very High
```
